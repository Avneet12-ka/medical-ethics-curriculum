                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to this interactive case study on ethical dilemmas in genetic testing within the Malaysian healthcare context. This case will explore the complex ethical issues that arise when genetic information affects not just individual patients but entire families and communities.</p>
                
                <p>As you work through this case, you'll be asked to make decisions at critical points, and your choices will influence how the scenario unfolds. The case will challenge you to apply ethical principles while considering Malaysian cultural contexts and healthcare realities.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
                <p>By completing this case study, you will be able to:</p>
                <ul>

                        <p>Dr. Mei Ling welcomes Aisha to her office at the University Hospital. Aisha has come alone for this initial consultation, though she mentions that her husband and mother are in the waiting room.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Mei Ling:</strong> "Thank you for coming in today, Aisha. I understand you're interested in genetic counseling because of a family history of Huntington's disease. Can you tell me more about your concerns?"</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Aisha:</strong> "Yes, my father's brother died from Huntington's disease five years ago. My father is 60 and hasn't shown any symptoms, but I know this disease can appear later in life. My husband and I want to start a family soon, and I'm worried about whether I might have inherited the gene and could pass it to our children."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Mei Ling:</strong> "I understand your concerns. Huntington's disease is indeed hereditary, and there is a 50% chance that children of an affected parent will inherit the condition. Since your uncle had the condition, there's a possibility your father carries the gene, even if he hasn't shown symptoms yet. And if he does, you would have a 50% chance of inheriting it."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Aisha:</strong> "That's what I've read. I want to know for sure whether I carry the gene. But... I'm also worried about what this might mean for my family. My father doesn't know I'm here. He doesn't like to talk about his brother's illness, and I think he's afraid to find out if he has the gene himself."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Mei Ling:</strong> "This is a complex situation, Aisha. Genetic testing for Huntington's disease can provide clear information about whether you carry the gene, but the results have implications not just for you but potentially for other family members as well, including your father."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Aisha:</strong> "I hadn't thought about that. If I test positive, that would mean my father definitely has the gene, wouldn't it? Even if he doesn't want to know..."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Mei Ling:</strong> "Yes, that's correct. This is one of the ethical challenges with genetic testing - sometimes the results reveal information about relatives who haven't chosen to be tested themselves."</p>

                            <p>Recommend proceeding with genetic testing based on Aisha's request, focusing on her right to know her genetic status for family planning purposes. Suggest ways she might approach discussions with her father afterward if needed.</p>

If you decide to proceed with testing, we can discuss ways to handle the implications for your father and other relatives."</p>

                        <p><strong>Dr. Mei Ling:</strong> "I understand. Before we proceed, I want to make sure you fully understand what the test results might mean for you psychologically. A positive result would mean you will develop Huntington's disease at some point in your life, though we can't predict exactly when symptoms would begin."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Aisha:</strong> "I've thought about that. It would be difficult news, but I think not knowing is harder for me right now."</p>
                        
                        <p>Dr. Mei Ling provides detailed information about the testing process and arranges for Aisha to meet with a psychologist who specializes in genetic testing issues. Two weeks later, Aisha returns for the test.</p>
                        
                        <p>One month later, Aisha returns alone to receive her results.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Mei Ling:</strong> "Aisha, I have your test results. The test shows that you do carry the genetic mutation for Huntington's disease."</p>
                        
                        <p>Aisha sits quietly for a moment, absorbing the news.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Aisha:</strong> "I... I suspected this might be the case. This means my father has it too, even though he hasn't shown symptoms yet."</p>

                        <p><strong>Aisha:</strong> "I don't know how to tell him. He's always avoided talking about his brother's illness. This will force him to confront something he's been trying to avoid."</p>
                        
                        <p>Two days later, Dr. Mei Ling receives a call from Aisha's father, who is upset after learning about Aisha's test from her mother. He demands to know why testing was done without consulting him, given the implications for his own health status.</p>
