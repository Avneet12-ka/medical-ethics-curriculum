                        <p>Dr. Amir has called a family meeting to discuss Encik Tan's care plan. Encik Tan's condition has deteriorated significantly in the past 48 hours, with increasing pain, respiratory distress, and periods of confusion. The family gathers in a small conference room near the palliative care unit.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Amir:</strong> "Thank you all for coming today. I wanted to discuss Encik Tan's current condition and our care plan moving forward. As you've seen, his condition has worsened significantly. The cancer has spread extensively, and he's experiencing increasing pain and breathing difficulties."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>David:</strong> "What treatment options do we have, doctor? Surely there must be something more we can do. My father is a fighter—he wouldn't want us to give up."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Grace:</strong> "David, you haven't been here these past months. Dad made it clear to me and Mom that he didn't want extraordinary measures when the time came. He wanted to be comfortable, not hooked up to machines."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>David:</strong> (visibly upset) "How can you say that? As if I don't care enough? I'm saying we should explore every option. That's what a good son does."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Puan Tan:</strong> (quietly) "Please don't argue. This is difficult for all of us." (Turning to Dr. Amir) "Doctor, what do you recommend? We want what's best for my husband."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Amir:</strong> "I understand this is an incredibly difficult time for your family. Before Encik Tan's cognitive decline, he did express to our team that he wanted comfort-focused care rather than aggressive interventions when his condition reached this stage. However, I recognize that family input is very important in making these decisions, especially in our cultural context."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>David:</strong> "With all due respect, doctor, in Chinese tradition, it's the family's responsibility to ensure everything possible is done. It would be disrespectful to my father not to try every available treatment."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Grace:</strong> "But Dad specifically said he didn't want that. Shouldn't we respect his wishes?"</p>
                        
                        <p>Dr. Amir notices that Puan Tan is becoming increasingly distressed by the disagreement between her children. He needs to navigate this family conflict while determining the most appropriate care plan for Encik Tan.</p>
