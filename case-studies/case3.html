                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to this interactive case study on resource allocation ethics within the Malaysian healthcare context. This case will explore the complex ethical issues that arise when healthcare resources are limited and difficult decisions must be made about their distribution.</p>
                
                <p>As you work through this case, you'll be asked to make decisions at critical points, and your choices will influence how the scenario unfolds. The case will challenge you to apply ethical principles while considering Malaysian healthcare realities, including the dual public-private system and socioeconomic factors.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
                <p>By completing this case study, you will be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify key ethical issues in healthcare resource allocation in Malaysia</li>
                    <li>Apply ethical frameworks to resource allocation decisions</li>
                    <li>Navigate tensions between individual patient needs and population health</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Fundamental ethical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice)</li>
                        <li>Basic structure of the Malaysian healthcare system (public and private sectors)</li>

                        <p>Dr. Rahman has called a meeting of the hospital's budget committee to discuss resource allocation for the coming fiscal year. The hospital has received its annual budget from the Ministry of Health, but the funds are insufficient to meet all departments' requests. Difficult decisions must be made about priorities.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Rahman:</strong> "Thank you all for coming today. As you know, we've received our budget allocation for the next fiscal year. Unfortunately, it's a 5% increase from last year, which doesn't keep pace with inflation or our growing patient population. We need to make some difficult decisions about how to allocate these limited resources."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Rahman:</strong> "We have two major funding requests on the table today. Dr. Chong has requested funds to add ten new dialysis machines and staff to operate them, which would reduce our waiting list for dialysis. Dr. Lakshmi has requested budget approval to add three new expensive cancer medications to our formulary, which could benefit patients with advanced cancers who have failed standard treatments."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Chong:</strong> "I want to emphasize the critical nature of our dialysis shortage. We currently have over 100 patients on the waiting list, and some have been waiting for more than a year. Many are deteriorating while they wait, and some have died before receiving treatment. These are patients who could live many more years with proper dialysis."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Lakshmi:</strong> "While I understand the dialysis situation is difficult, cancer patients also face life-threatening conditions. These new medications have shown significant benefits in clinical trials, extending life by 6-18 months with improved quality of life. Currently, patients who could benefit from these treatments either go without or must pay out-of-pocket at private facilities, which most cannot afford."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Sister Maria:</strong> "I'd like to add another perspective. Both these requests focus on treating advanced disease. Should we also consider allocating more resources to preventive care? For instance, better diabetes management could reduce the number of patients needing dialysis in the future."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Rahman:</strong> "These are all valid points. Unfortunately, our budget constraints mean we cannot fully fund both major requests, and any funds directed to preventive programs would further limit what's available for these immediate needs. We need to make a decision based on ethical principles and the greatest benefit for our patient population."</p>
