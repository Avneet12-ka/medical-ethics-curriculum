                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to this interactive case study on informed consent challenges within the Malaysian healthcare context. This case will explore the complex ethical issues that arise when obtaining informed consent in a multicultural society with diverse languages, educational backgrounds, and cultural perspectives on healthcare decision-making.</p>
                
                <p>As you work through this case, you'll be asked to make decisions at critical points, and your choices will influence how the scenario unfolds. The case will challenge you to apply ethical principles while considering Malaysian cultural contexts and legal requirements.</p>
                
                <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
                <p>By completing this case study, you will be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify key challenges in obtaining valid informed consent in multicultural Malaysian settings</li>
                    <li>Apply ethical principles to informed consent processes with patients from diverse backgrounds</li>
                    <li>Navigate language barriers and cultural differences in healthcare decision-making</li>
                    <li>Balance respect for family involvement with patient autonomy</li>
                    <li>Develop strategies for ensuring meaningful informed consent in complex situations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="pre-knowledge">
                    <h3>Pre-Knowledge Check</h3>
                    <p>Before beginning this case, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The four elements of valid informed consent (disclosure, understanding, voluntariness, and capacity)</li>
                        <li>Malaysian legal requirements for informed consent</li>
                        <li>Cultural factors that influence healthcare decision-making in Malaysian society</li>
                        <li>The ethical principle of respect for autonomy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you need to review these concepts, please refer to Lecture 3: Informed Consent and Patient Autonomy in this curriculum.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Aisha and Dr. Tan are meeting with Puan Fatimah and her son Ahmad to discuss Puan Fatimah's diagnosis and treatment plan. Puan Fatimah has been diagnosed with gallbladder cancer that requires surgical intervention.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Tan:</strong> "Good morning, Puan Fatimah, Encik Ahmad. We've received the results of Puan Fatimah's tests, and I'm afraid they confirm our suspicion of gallbladder cancer. We need to perform surgery to remove the gallbladder and possibly some surrounding tissue."</p>
                        
                        <p>Dr. Tan speaks directly to Ahmad in English, using technical medical terminology. Ahmad nods, while Puan Fatimah looks confused.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Ahmad:</strong> (to Dr. Tan) "What are her chances of recovery? Is this operation absolutely necessary?"</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Tan:</strong> "Without surgery, the prognosis is poor. With surgery, we can potentially remove all the cancer if it hasn't spread too far. There are risks, of course, as with any major surgery, but it's her best option."</p>
                        
                        <p>Dr. Aisha notices that Puan Fatimah is not being included in the conversation and that the discussion is happening in English, which Puan Fatimah doesn't speak fluently.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Puan Fatimah:</strong> (in Malay to her son) "Apa yang doktor cakap? Ada masalah serius ke?" (What is the doctor saying? Is there a serious problem?)</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Ahmad:</strong> (in Malay to his mother) "Jangan risau, ibu. Ada masalah dengan hempedu, doktor akan buat pembedahan untuk betulkan." (Don't worry, mother. There's a problem with your gallbladder, the doctor will do surgery to fix it.)</p>
                        
                        <p>Ahmad deliberately avoids mentioning cancer to his mother, believing it would cause her unnecessary distress.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Dr. Tan:</strong> "I'll need you to sign the consent form for the surgery. We'd like to schedule it for next week."</p>
                        
                        <p>Dr. Tan hands the consent form to Ahmad, who begins to read it.</p>
